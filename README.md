# Minesweeper in ClojureScript

This repo was created to better learn Clojure/ClojureScript. It's built using
* [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) to provide hot code loading, code bundling, etc. 
* [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) to provide bindings to React.
